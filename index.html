    <h2>Hello! My name is Amiya</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring Web and Software developer so this semester, I simultaniously took this web design course, a javascript course,
    and a python course to help me reach my goal of becoming a full stack developer! I also took a Principles of Operating Systems course to help me understand how software interacts with hardware.
    These courses are apart of my major requirements in order to transfer to a 4 year university to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science!<br><br>
    This website will be dedicated to teaching the basics of HTML and CSS web development. I will be including tutorials, examples, and resources to help beginners get started with web design. Whether you're looking to create a personal blog, portfolio, or just want to learn more about web development, this site has something for you!<br><br>
    Thank you for visiting and I hope you find the information helpful!
